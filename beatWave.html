		<p>I am developing BeatWave with Noura Howell, Simon Scott, and Chip Malt to bring the performative affordances of Leap Motion to DJing.  Leap Motion is a device that tracks hand and finger movement in 3D space.  I am leading storyboard development, and contributing to the contextual inquiry, persona development, brainstorming, and protyping</p>
		<h2>Process</h2>
		<p> We started the project with Noura's intuition that the affordances of Leap Motion go hand in hand with music and sound visualization.  After researching sound manipulation technologies, we saw an opportunity to bring the performative and fun aspects of Leap Motion to DJing.  To test our assumptions, we conducted six contextual inquiries with DJ's and digital musicians and found that nothing dampens a DJ's spirit like using laptop hardware.  We also concluded that there are many types of DJ's and many ways to manipulate sound, so we needed to narrow our focus for the scope of the class.</p>
