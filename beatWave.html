		<h2>Beat Wave</h2>

		<p>I am developing BeatWave with Noura Howell, Simon Scott, and Chip Malt for the UC Berkeley class INFO 213 to bring the performative affordances of Leap Motion to DJing.  Leap Motion is a device that tracks hand and finger movement in 3D space.  I am leading storyboard development, and contributing to the contextual inquiry, persona development, brainstorming, and protyping.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>User Research</h3>
		<p> We started the project with Noura's intuition that the affordances of Leap Motion go hand in hand with music and sound visualization.  After researching sound manipulation technologies, we saw an opportunity to bring the performative and fun aspects of Leap Motion to DJing.  To test our assumptions, we conducted six contextual inquiries with DJ's and digital musicians and compiled our observations into 3 key personas, which motivated the rest of our design. We found that nothing dampens a DJ's spirit like using laptop hardware.</p>

		<h3>Low Fi Prototypes</h3>
		<p>We also concluded that there are many types of DJ's and many ways to manipulate sound, so we needed to narrow our focus for the scope of the class. To do this, we compiled our observations and feedback from the DJ's to develop 3 paper prototypes with different approaches, including a different technology, Myo, which is a bracelet that tracks hand motions by muscle activity.  Though Leap was our initial strategy, we did not want to exclude different technologies that may serve DJ's better.  For the Myo prototype, we intended to leverage Myo's gesture recognition technology to trigger sound clips.</p>

They transition between songs using the Mixer.</span></figcaption>

		<figcaption><span>A usage scenario for my teammate's prototype, the "BlobMaster".</span></figcaption>
		<p>After testing the dual grid paper prototype, we found that users liked the control it afforded and found the interaction intuitive.  We decided to move forward with that version, and I developed a hi fi Justinmind prototype for the setup interface while my team mates implemented two different functional prototypes, one with Leap and one with Myo. Since our paper prototype users found the setup screen confusing, I integrated it into the main screen in the Justinmind version.  Myo also tracks forearm angle, so we used it to modulate effects.</p>

		<h3>Technology</h3>
		<p> We conducted several more tests on DJ's and novices alike using these prototypes.  At this point, we began to notice fatal flaws with both Leap and Myo.  Leap would lose track of users' hands.  It also took time to calibrate at the beginning.  Myo failed to recognize gestures most of the time, especially on small arms.  Promisingly though, Myo reliably tracked arm angle.  We decided to move forward with Myo, since ultimately DJ's found it more fun.  We also rejected a full screen UI in favor of a narrow one that wouldn't obscure the DJ software and music visualizations.  Below is the final design iteration and a video demonstrating its capabilities.</p>
