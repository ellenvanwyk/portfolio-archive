		<h1>Local Ground Redesign</h1>
		<div style="text-align: center; background-color: rgb(226, 227, 229);"><img style="height: 300px; margin: auto; text-align: center;" src="images/home-images/localground.png"></div>

		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p class = "body-text">Local Ground is an open source tool for creating map visualizations and stories. I am redesigning the UI from beginning to end. This process includes <span class = "skill">user research, wireframing, visual and UX design, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript prototyping.</span> </p>
		<p>Existing map making platforms either support qualitative (photos, writing, audio, drawings), or quantitative (numerical) data. With Local Ground, users can combine these data types, resulting in more powerful storytelling and a deeper understanding of the problem space. Our user groups include <a href = 'http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1926194'>community organizations</a> and <a href = 'http://tap2k.org/papers/ICLS2016.pdf'>grade school classrooms</a>.</p>

		<h2>Heuristic Evaluation + Research</h2>
		<p class = "body-text">Since Local Ground already exists, I started the redesign by researching the existing use cases, speaking with team members, and conducting a <span class = "skill">heuristic evaluation</span>. I also conducted <span class = "skill">competitive research</span> in order to better define Local Ground as a product and to understand common UI patterns. My findings include the following:
		<ul>
			<li><span class = "bullet-lead">Increase Accessibility: </span>The existing Local Ground UI was modeled after the database representation of data. While this can be useful pedagogically, it presents a high barrier to entry and excludes some users.</li>
			<li><span class = "bullet-lead">Market Opportunity: </span>Map making tools fall under one of the following categories: quantitative and powerful, and story/visuals oriented. We have the unique opportunity and challenge to straddle these two spaces. The former systems tend towards technical power users, while the latter are easy to learn and use.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<h2>Wireframing</h2>
		<p class = "body-text">When I felt comfortable with the existing product and landscape, I began to create <span class = "skill">wireframes in Sketch</span> to communicate my suggestions, which included the following large structural changes:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><span class = "bullet-lead">Support media and browsing better: </span>Move the description/media display to panel on the left instead of a popover. The popover supports short descriptions well, but long descriptions obscured the map. The left panel also achieves our goal of foregrounding media and content.<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/LOCALGROUND/wireframe-1.png" style="width:70%;margin: auto;padding: 20px 0;"></div></li>
			<li><span class = "bullet-lead">Clean up map: </span>Initially, media were plotted on the map as their media type. This meant that multiple photos for a single location might be stacked on top of each other as individual instances. Since the photo thumbnails were used for the map pins, this created additional visual confusion. I proposed requiring each photo to be contained in a site in order to be plotted on the map.<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/LOCALGROUND/wireframe-2.png" style="width:70%;margin: auto;padding: 20px 0;"></div></li>
			<li><span class = "bullet-lead">Use "Projects" to organize: </span>In the existing version, users switch between projects by turning on and off datasets, and the map preferences (such as map skin and center) are saved as cookies. I recommended making a separate page for each project to better facilitate work on a single project and fit common mental models.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Choosing a Prototyping Tool</h2>
		<p>Once our team had aligned on the structure of the site, I began to prototype the interaction details. I chose <span class = "skill">HTML/CSS/Javascript</span> because I knew that prototyping software becomes slow and difficult to use with complex systems, and because the CSS could be used in the implementation phase.</p>
		<h2>Initial User Testing</h2>
		<p>I recruited 5 users for our first round of testing. Research sessions included an <span class = "skill">interview</span> on previous exposure to map making software and Local Ground, and then a series of <span class = "skill">tasks</span>. Our main findings included the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><span class = "bullet-lead">Improved workflow: </span>Overall, users who had experience with the old design found that the new design better foregrounded the tasks they needed to complete.</li>
			<li><span class = "bullet-lead">Fix Terminology: </span>We confirmed that some of our labeling terminology was confusing. While this design improved on the previous version, where icons were unlabeled, I began to conduct additional research on mapping and GIS terminology for inspiration.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Iterations and Visual Desgin</h2>
		<p>Once we had validated the overall structure of the site, I started to prototype <span class = "skill">interaction</span> details and iterate on the <span class = "skill">visual design</span>. My team went out into the city of Berkeley and photographed public artwork. Using real data helps me design for the worst case scenarios, and resulted in an interesting mini project to present at the Local Ground workshop</p>
		<p>The interaction design process involved research into components with similar functions. As a single person design team, I sought to optimize my resources by using common, well understood interaction patterns rather than developing new ones that I wouldn't be able to test thoroughly.</p>
		<p>I used material design guidelines, including cards to guide the visual design. In to foreground user content and avoid pandering to younger users, I used a simple, light, and modern color palette.</p>
		<p class = "desktop" style = "margin-bottom:40px;">Below are some pages from the current iteration of the prototype</p>
		<div id = "lg-map-view" class = "design-feature"></div>
		<div id = "lg-media-view" class = "design-feature"></div>
		<div id = "lg-presentation-view" class = "design-feature"></div>
		<h2>Next Steps</h2>
		<p>I am currently running another round of user testing.</p>
