		<p>Amaze is a single player puzzle game for iOS where the player who creates the most complicated maze wins.  Anton Holmberg and I made it for the 2014 UC Berkeley UPE Game Jam, where it won 3rd place.  I designed the interface and graphics and Anton coded the game in Xcode using Objective C.  </p>

		<h3>Constraints</h3>
		<p>We had 22 hours to make the game (actually less, becuase we both wanted to sleep), so we tried to identify the essential gameplay features and make the most of the simplicity using graphics. We wanted to make a 3D game, but realized that aerial view mazes were fundamentally 2D games.  This limited my design to flat png tiles, where the object had to fill the corners of the square to prevent gaps between diagonal blocks.  I also had to make an animation that could loop several times.<p>
		<h3>Look and Feel</h3>
		<p>  I hadn't designed for abstract 2D games before, so I spent time collecting reference.  The game has 3 elements to construct the maze: stationary blocks, moveable blocks, and blocks that slow the player down when it passes.  We decided to use the metaphor of bush, rock, and ice block for these items respectively, though I realize some may perceive bushes to be more moveable than blocks.  To unify the look and feel, I chose to make all the components saccharine, magical, and cartoonish.</p>
		<h3>Story</h3>
		<p>Originally, the game involved two separate mazes with different finish lines.  I wanted to bring the excitement of a racing game, so we decided to have animated characters that would reach the same spot.  </p>
